# Data Projects Portfolio (WIP)

Pages:
- index.html — hero with centered frosted image and CTA
- projects.html — tile grid (no visible links on tiles; whole tile is clickable)
- contact.html — email + social links with copy-to-clipboard
- resume.html — embedded /assets/resume.pdf with download button
- projects/*.html — sample detail pages

Edit:
- Replace "Your Name" in nav/footer (all pages).
- Email in contact.html (`email@example.com`).
- Social links in contact.html.
- Replace assets/resume.pdf with your PDF.
- Add projects in projects.json (thumbs in /assets).

Theme: dark ↔ light toggle persisted with localStorage.
